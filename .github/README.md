# Content for SyDjango.org website

## Introduction

SyDjango.org is built using [Astro](https://astro.build/) and hosted on
[Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).

If you're wondering why not Django, here a few reasons:

- Cloudflare Pages has generous free tier limits, effectively providing hosting for free
- Cloudflare Edge Network makes the website fast in any part of Australia and the World
- We unfortunately can't host Django on Cloudflare
- Astro is a modern Jamstack framework that works well with Cloudflare Pages
- While we love Django we also love learning and trying other technologies

## How to Contribute

We are always looking for new content, so if you have something interesting to share, please do so.

Simply fork the repo and submit a pull request. We will review it and merge if it meets our
standards or request changes otherwise. Once your MR is merged, the changes will be automatically
deployed.

The rest of the website code is managed in a private repo, so you can't see it here. If you are
interested in contributing to the rest of the website, please let us know.
