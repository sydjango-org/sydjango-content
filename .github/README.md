# Content for SyDjango.org website

## Introduction

SyDjango.org is built using [Astro](https://astro.build/). We host it on
[Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).

Note: If you wondering why it's not built using Django, there are a few reasons:

- Cloudflare Pages has generous free tier limits, making our hosting costs effectively equal zero
- We distribute the website using Cloudflare's Edge Network, which makes it fast in any part of
  Australia and the World
- We can't host Django on Cloudflare
- Astro is a modern Jamstack framework and it works well with Cloudflare Pages. So why not to give
  it a try?
- While we love Django, we also love learning and trying new things

Simply fork the repo and submit a pull request. We will review and merge if it meets our guidelines
