As software systems grow in size and complexity, it’s more important than ever to understand and
rein in their behaviour in production. This talk introduces OpenTelemetry and OpenFeature to Django
developers, two fast-rising projects incubated by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.

We’ll discuss the foundations of the modern observability stack and how robust feature management
can bring superpowers to a team and accelerate the development and operation of Django-based
software systems.

minimise resource usage.

Modern applications contain a lot of moving parts to enable interactivity. That in turn breeds
complexity in the tool-sets that we use. HTMX is a clean and refreshing way of creating interactive
apps (think ajax, websockets, etc) most of the app sitting on the back-end and the front end is just
HTML sprinkled with a few magic attributes. \r\n\r\nIn this talk we'll have a quick dive into the
what HTMX is followed by the mechanics and a small demo so that you too can build fast and validate.
