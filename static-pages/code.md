# Code of Conduct

## Purpose

The SyDjango group is dedicated to providing a respectful, friendly, and inclusive environment for
all members. We aim to encourage sharing and collaboration in the Python and Django community in
Sydney. We expect all community participants to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community
venues—online and in-person as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community
business. This Code of Conduct is adapted from the PyCon Code of Conduct and is subject to change
and adaptation as the needs of the community evolve.

## Expected Behavior

- Be considerate, respectful, and collaborative.
- Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
- Be mindful of your surroundings and your fellow participants.
- Alert group leaders if you notice a dangerous situation or someone in distress.

## Examples of Unacceptable Behavior

- Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable. This includes, but is not limited
  to:
- Threats or violent language directed against another person.
- Discriminatory jokes and language.
- Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
- Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or
  disability.
- Inappropriate photography or recording.
- Unwelcome sexual attention.
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.

If you are subjected to unacceptable behavior, notice that someone else is being subjected to it, or
have any other concerns, please notify a SyDjango group organizer as soon as possible.

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member will not be tolerated. Anyone asked to stop
unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. If a community member engages in
unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including
a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community.
