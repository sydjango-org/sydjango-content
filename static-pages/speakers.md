the information you need to prepare for this.

First of all, please submit our [talk proposal form](https://sydjango.org/propose-talk). Once done,
SyDjango org team will be notified and one of us will be in touch to confirm the date and the rest
of details. Thank you for volunteering!

Next, start preparing for your talk to be ready on the scheduled date. Please, keep reading further
for some advices.

Finally, sometimes things don't go as planned. We understand this. If situation changed on your side
and you can't anymore present on the scheduled date, please try to let us know as soon as you can
and we will be happy to reschedule your talk.

Don't hesitate to ask questions!

## Talks format

We are broadly trying to copy the same talks format as PyCon Australia. The general format is as
follows:

- Regular talks: 30 minutes. We recommend to aim for 20 min talk + 10 min Q&A.
- Lightning talks: 5 minutes. Slides are encouraged but not required.

## Topics

An incomplete list of high-level topics the group is interested is below:

- OSS projects related to Django
- APIs
- Backend Development
- Frontend Development
- Infrastructure
- DevOps
- Software Reliability
- Scalability
- Security
- QA
- Data
- ML/AI
- Soft Skills
- Career in Tech
- Startups

We are happy to accept talks that are at least loosely connected to Django. Of course, the stronger
the connection is the better.

## Can you give me some tips to prepare for my talk?

Sure, please find below some common sense advice for preparing your talk.

### Mind your target audience

We have engineers of all levels attending our events. It's usually a good ideal to assume the
minimal knowledge from the audience. It doesn't matter how advanced your topic is please try to make
it accessible to everyone.

### Keep it simple

Skip unnecessary details. The simpler your material is the easier it is to follow and comprehend.

### Be concise

Use simple language. Avoid jargon unless it's an essential part of your talk.

### Be coherent

It's always easier to follow material when its logical parts are well connected. Ideally, try to
make your presentation sound like a story.

### Use visuals

Visuals can supplement your presentation very well and make your ideas clearer.

### Practice

The more you rehearse your talk the higher chance you can deliver the material smoothly.

### Time your talk

If you are planning to make your talk longer than 20 minutes, please think twice. It requires a very
high level of presentation skills to engage audience longer than this. If the topic is too large,
consider cutting it down into smaller parts.

### Be prepared for questions

Good speakers can anticipate audience questions and are always ready to answer them. It's usually a
good idea to dedicate some time to thinking about potential questions as part of your preparation.

### Use examples and analogues

Use real-world examples to illustrate what you are speaking about and consider adding analogies.
Good analogies make your talk easier to understand.

### Be yourself

Speak in your natural voice, be honest, and don't be afraid to show your personality. It will help
you to avoid additional stress and save energy during the talk.

### Be cautious with live demos

It will be far easier for you to speak over your prerecorded demos which will increase audience
engagement and prevent potential technical issues.

### Code of Conduct

Last, but not least. Your talk must be aligned with our
[code of conduct](https://sydjango.org/code). Please, make sure you are familiar with it.
