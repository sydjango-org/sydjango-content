## Talks format

We are broadly trying to copy the same talks format as PyCon Australia. The general format is as
follows:

- Regular talks: 30 minutes. We recommend to aim for 20 min talk + 10 min Q&A.
- Lightning talks: 5 minutes. Slides are encouraged but not required.

## Topics

The incomplete list of high-level topics the group members are interested is below:

– OSS projects related to Django – APIs – Backend Software Engineering – Frontend Software
Engineering – Infrastructure – DevOps – Site Reliability Engineering – Scalability – Security – QA –
Data – ML/AI – Soft Skills – Career in Tech – Startups

We are happy to accept talks that are at least loosely connected to Django. Of course, the stronger
the connection is the better.

## Can you help me to prepare for my talk?

Sure, please find below some common sense advice for preparing your talk.

### Mind your target audience

We have engineers of all levels attending our events. It's usually a good ideal to assume the
minimal knowledge on the topic from the audience. It doesn't matter how advanced your topic is
please try to make it accessible to everyone.

### Keep it simple

Please skip unnecessary details. The simpler your material is the easier it is to follow and
comprehend.

### Be concise

Use simple language. Avoid jargon unless it's an essential part of your talk.

### Work on connecting parts of your talks

It's always easier to follow the material when its logical parts are well connected. Ideally, try to
make your presentation sound like a story.

### Use visuals

Visuals can supplement your presentation very well and make your ideas clearer.

### Practice

The more you rehearse your talk the higher chance you can deliver the material smoothly.

### Time your talk

If you are planning to make your talk longer than 20 minutes, please think twice. It requires a very
high level of presentation skills to engage audience longer than this. If the topic is too large,
consider cutting it down into smaller digestible parts.

### Be prepared for questions

Good speakers can anticipate questions from the audience and are always ready to answer them. It's a
good idea to dedicate some time to think about potential questions the audience can have.

### Use examples and analogues

Use real-world examples to illustrate what you are speaking about and consider adding analogies.
Good analogies can make your talk more engaging.

### Just be yourself

Speak in your natural voice, be honest, and don't be afraid to show your personality. It will help
you to avoid additional stress and save energy.

### Be cautious with live demos

It will be far easier for you to speak over your prerecorded demos and it will increase audience
comprehension.

### Code of Conduct

Last, but not least. Your talk must be aligned with our
[code of conduct](https://sydjango.org/code). Please, make sure you are familiar with it.
